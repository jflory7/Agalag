We are the 2013 Duke Talent Identification Program students
at the University of Georgia taking the Team Programming for
Video Games class during the first term of the program. Most
of the students in the class began programming for the first
time at the beginning of the term in June, and the program
lasted three weeks. This project is the cumulation of our work
in the class, and it shows the progress we have made on numerous
aspects of our work on programming, including programming
skills, design, and other aspects of working on a video game.
